MyCalculator:

- knows basic operations (multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, plus/minus signs);
- it is able to exponentiate and subtract roots;
- handles decimal and thousand separation;
- it is able to calculate percentages;
- it has memory functions;
- it has responsive, mobile-friendly appearance.

-  it can be skinned, with at least three different designs and fonts: I did it, but the backchange is not perfect(I'm still looking for a solution).
-  it can handle localization (at least hu, en): I started it, but due to lack of time I haven't reached the end yet(I'm still looking for a solution).

P.s.: I found this test task in the spam folder at April 26, the deadline is April 30, so I uploaded what is ready up to this point.
I would like to send the final version in a few days, if it is possible.
